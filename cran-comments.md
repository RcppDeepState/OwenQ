# Release version 1.0.0 (2017-06-26)

## Release summary

- This is the first submission.

- The two NOTES from R CMD check are expected.

- The WARNING from R CMD check is related to the boost library in the BH package. More precisely, it is related to the file `bernoulli_details.hpp` which is not used by my package (it uses only `owens-t.hpp` which does not include `bernoulli_detail.hpp`). I do not know how I could fix this warning.

## Test environments

   * ubuntu 14.04, R 3.4.0
   * windows 7 64bit, R 3.3.3
   * windows 7 64bit, R 3.5.3
